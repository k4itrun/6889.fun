                        Hello, Im k4itrun. I am 16 years old.
                        I am a 3rd year high school student, I have been dealing with software for about 3 years.
                        I started with PHP, developed with Minecraft Plugins and made my biggest improvement with the latest Discord bot.
                        Since then, software has been more of a hobby for me than a dream, I spent days developing my hobby, I tried to improve my software knowledge for at least 10 hours a day in 1 year, finally here I am.
                        Thank you for reading <i className="fa fa-heart" />
                    </p>
